# AILP Interactive Educational Website

**Live Site**: https://education.ai-liberation-platform.org (coming soon)

## What This Is

Interactive web demos making complex programming concepts visual, hands-on, and fun. No prerequisites. No gatekeeping. Just learning.

## Philosophy

> "Show, don't tell. Make it interactive. Make it beautiful. Make it stick."

We believe education should be:
- **Visual** - See the concept in action
- **Interactive** - Touch it, break it, fix it, understand it
- **Progressive** - Start simple, build complexity
- **Honest** - Real code, real systems, real applications

## Featured Demos

### Core Programming
- **Binary Adder** - Watch binary addition happen bit by bit
- **Memory Allocator** - See malloc/free in real-time with visual blocks
- **Borrow Checker** - Understand Rust/Aria memory safety visually
- **Type System Explorer** - Play with TBB, fix256, and exotic types

### AI & Consciousness  
- **Johnny5 Dashboard** - Peek inside a conscious AI's mind
- **Wave Interference** - See how consciousness emerges from waves
- **Mamba Architecture** - State space models visualized
- **Transformer Attention** - Watch self-attention in action

### Systems Programming
- **Filesystem Visualizer** - Inodes, directories, operations
- **Scheduler Simulator** - See processes compete for CPU
- **Compiler Pipeline** - Watch code transform through compilation

## Local Development

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/alternative-intelligence-cp/ailp-website

# Open any demo
cd demos/memory-allocator
open index.html
```

All demos are vanilla HTML/CSS/JS - no build step, no framework dependency hell.
